The study was conducted by a team of international scientists, including Dr. Luke Clark, director of the Cambridge University Gambling Studies Program.</p>
<p>The study found that people with a higher level of dopamine activity in a specific brain region were more likely to develop gambling problems. This may be because this area is involved in decision-making and risk assessment.</p>
<p>The research involved scanning the brains of people with and without gambling problems while they played a game involving choices between monetary rewards and risky bets. The study found that people with higher dopamine levels in a specific brain region were more likely to take risks when gambling.</p>
<p>This research could help to improve our understanding of why some people develop gambling problems, and may lead to the development of new treatments for problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Tell-if-You-Have-a-Gambling-Problem-–-Monkeys-Hold-the-Key"><a href="#How-to-Tell-if-You-Have-a-Gambling-Problem-–-Monkeys-Hold-the-Key" class="headerlink" title="How to Tell if You Have a Gambling Problem – Monkeys Hold the Key"></a>How to Tell if You Have a Gambling Problem – Monkeys Hold the Key</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and enjoyable way to pass the time, but for some people it can become a problem. If you are worried that you may have a gambling problem, there are some key signs to look out for.</p>
<p>One sign of a gambling problem is if you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time. This can include constantly checking your phone to see if any sports bets or casino games have come in, or obsessively reading about betting odds online.</p>
<p>Another sign is if gambling starts to affect your everyday life. This could mean spending more and more time and money on betting, neglecting important responsibilities such as work or school, or getting into debt because of your gambling habit.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any of these signs it is important to seek help. There are many organisations both online and in person that can provide support and advice for people with gambling problems.</p>
<p>So how do monkeys hold the key to stopping gambling addiction?<br>Professor Gamble and his team of researchers at Cambridge University believe they may have found an answer. In a study published in the journal Neuron, they report how they managed to stop monkeys from becoming addicted to gambling by blocking a specific brain pathway.</p>
<p>The pathway, called the striatum, is known to be involved in reward-seeking behaviour including addiction to drugs and alcohol. The team used a technique known as optogenetics to block activity in the striatum in monkeys that were already addicted to gambling. This stopped them from wanting to gamble any further and effectively cured their addiction.</p>
<p>While this research is still in its early stages, it offers hope that we may one day be able to similarly block the striatum in humans with gambling problems, curing their addiction. In the meantime however, if you think you may have a gambling problem it is important to get help from professionals.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-That-Monkeys’-Journey-can-Predict-Addiction-Behaviour"><a href="#Study-Shows-That-Monkeys’-Journey-can-Predict-Addiction-Behaviour" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows That Monkeys’ Journey can Predict Addiction Behaviour"></a>Study Shows That Monkeys’ Journey can Predict Addiction Behaviour</h1><p>A study published in the journal “Nature” has shown that the journey of a monkey’s prefrontal cortex can be used to predict its addiction behaviour. The study was conducted on rhesus monkeys and it found that those with the most immature prefrontal cortex were more likely to become addicted to cocaine.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is responsible for decision-making, impulsivity and self-control. The study found that the younger the monkey, the more immature its prefrontal cortex was and this was associated with a higher risk of addiction.</p>
<p>This is an important discovery as it could lead to better ways of predicting addiction behaviour in humans. It could also help in the development of treatments for addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Research-Suggests-That-Monkeys’-Journey-May-Be-Used-to-Diagnose-Gambling-Problems"><a href="#Research-Suggests-That-Monkeys’-Journey-May-Be-Used-to-Diagnose-Gambling-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Research Suggests That Monkeys’ Journey May Be Used to Diagnose Gambling Problems"></a>Research Suggests That Monkeys’ Journey May Be Used to Diagnose Gambling Problems</h1><p>If you’ve ever wondered if you have a gambling problem, researchers may soon have an answer for you: just ask the nearest monkey. A new study published in the journal “Neuropsychopharmacology” suggests that monkeys’ brains may be able to diagnose gambling addiction in humans.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers trained three macaque monkeys to gamble. The monkeys were given the opportunity to select either a high-risk or low-risk option in a game where they could earn rewards. Researchers used brain imaging technology to track the activity of dopamine neurons in the monkeys’ brains as they gambled.</p>
<p>The findings showed that when the monkeys selected the high-risk option, their dopamine neurons became more active. This suggests that the dopamine neurons are involved in risk assessment and decision making.</p>
<p>The study authors say that their findings could help us better understand gambling addiction in humans. They hope that one day we may be able to use brain imaging technology to diagnose and treat gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Monkeys’-Journey-Could-Potentially-be-Used-to-Detect-Gambling-Problems"><a href="#Monkeys’-Journey-Could-Potentially-be-Used-to-Detect-Gambling-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Monkeys’ Journey Could Potentially be Used to Detect Gambling Problems"></a>Monkeys’ Journey Could Potentially be Used to Detect Gambling Problems</h1><p>The gambling industry is a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to grow each year. While most people who gamble do so without any issues, for some individuals gambling can become a problem. Gambling addiction, also known as pathological gambling, is a serious mental health disorder that can lead to significant financial, legal, and relationship problems.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980 and is currently defined as “a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behaviour”. To be diagnosis with pathological gambling, an individual must meet five or more of the following criteria:</p>
<p>Gambling more than intended<br> Frequently risking more money than they can afford on bets Repeated unsuccessful efforts to stop gambling Gambling despite negative consequences such as debt or relationships problems Lying to conceal gambling behavior Feeling restless or irritable when trying to cut back on gambling Chasing losses by betting even more money Needing to bet more and more money to feel the same excitement</p>
<p>While there are no accurate statistics on how many people suffer from pathological gambling, it is estimated that between 1% and 3% of the population struggles with the disorder. Pathological gambling can impact any age group, but is most commonly seen in men aged 18-35.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for pathological gambling, but a combination of therapy and medication is often recommended. Some people find self-help groups helpful, while others find that medication such as naltrexone helps them stay abstinent from gambling.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling can have a significant impact on an individual’s life and can often be difficult to treat. However, with help from a therapist and/or medication, many people are able to overcome this disorder.</p>
