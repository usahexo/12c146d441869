#  Raiders to announce move to Las Vegas

The Oakland Raiders announced their move to Las Vegas on Monday.

Owner Mark Davis cited the "lack of an acceptable stadium solution" in Oakland as the main reason for the relocation. The Raiders will begin playing in Las Vegas in 2020.

"My father always said, 'the greatness of the Raiders is in its future,'" Davis said. "Las Vegas will be a world-class resort city and the new home of the Raiders."

The move has been met with mixed reactions. Some fans are excited about the prospect of having a team in Las Vegas, while others are disappointed that their team is leaving Oakland.

Local officials in Las Vegas are already working on a plan to build a new stadium for the Raiders. The stadium, which will cost $1.9 billion, is scheduled to be completed in time for the 2020 season.

The team's move became official on Monday, when NFL owners voted 31-1 in favor of the Raiders' move to Sin City. The lone vote against the move came from the Miami Dolphins owner, Stephen Ross.

The Raiders had been seeking a new home for years, as their stadium in Oakland is outdated and in poor condition. The team's impending departure from Oakland led to a lot of heated debate and discussion among fans and local officials.

Las Vegas was ultimately chosen as the team's new home due to its large market size and its ability to provide a new stadium that will be ready in time for the 2020 season.

Raiders owner Mark Davis said that he was "incredibly grateful" for the NFL's approval of the team's relocation. He added that he looked forward to "bringing a championship back to the Bay Area."

The Raiders will become the third NFL team to call Las Vegas home, joining the Broncos and Cowboys.

This is a huge move for the Raiders and for Las Vegas, and it will be interesting to see how it plays out. The Raiders have been searching for a new home since their stadium in Oakland was deemed unsuitable, and Las Vegas has finally come up with a proposal that has been accepted by the team.

The new stadium in Las Vegas will be financed by a combination of public and private money, and it is sure to be a major tourist attraction. It is expected to cost $1.8bn to build, and it will be the largest in North America when it is completed.
