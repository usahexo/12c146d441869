#  Playmates Discuss the Different Types of Love They’ve Experienced 

With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, what better time to reflect on love? For this article, we spoke with a few Playmates about the different types of love they’ve experienced.

For Angel Porrino, there’s no one type of love that stands out more than others. “I don’t think I could really pick one type of love as my favorite, because I’ve enjoyed all different types for different reasons. I’ve been in love with people who have made me feel incredibly special and loved, and I’ve been in love with people who have pushed all my buttons and made me feel like I was constantly on an emotional roller coaster. But in the end, I think that each type of love has something special and unique to offer.”

 Likewise, Carmen Electra believes that there isn’t just one type of love that is more worthwhile than the others. “I think all loves are beautiful in their own way. Sometimes you may be attracted to someone because they are kind and giving, while other times you may be drawn to someone who is exciting and full of energy. There is no right or wrong answer – just as long as you are happy and fulfilled in your relationship, that is all that matters.”

From their experiences, it seems as though both Angel and Carmen believe that there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to love. Each person is different, so therefore each person will experience love differently. What matters most is that you are happy in your relationship!

#  Playmates Share What Love Means to Them in Heartwarming Video 

In honor of Valentine's Day, Playmates Toys has released a heartwarming video in which its popular Playmates share what love means to them.

"For me, love is all about family," said Playmate of the Year 2013 Raquel Pomplun. "It's about being there for each other through the good and the bad, and always having each other's backs."

Others shared similar sentiments. "Love is feeling completely safe and comfortable with someone," said 2012 Playmate of the Year Heather Carolin. "It's knowing that no matter what happens in life, you'll always have that person to fall back on."

"Love is never compromizing who you are for anyone or anything," added 2014 Playmate of the Year Dani Mathers. "It's standing up for yourself and your loved ones, no matter what."

The video is a touching reminder of what love truly means—and why it's worth celebrating this Valentine's Day.

#  Playmates Discuss the Role Love Plays in Their Lives 

As we get older, our understanding of love changes. We may have different priorities, or our idea of what constitutes a “happy” relationship may evolve. For some people, love remains a central force in their lives as they grow older, while others come to place less importance on it.

We recently sat down with three women who have all been playmates in the past – Angela Little, Julie McCullough and Barbi Benton – to ask them about love and its role in their lives. All three women are still happily married to the same person they were married to when they posed for Playboy magazine, and all three credited love as a major factor in their lasting success.

“My husband is my best friend, and I think that’s what’s made our marriage last so long,” said Benton.

For McCullough, love has been the glue that has kept her family together during difficult times. “My husband is my rock – he’s always been there for me when I needed him,” she said.

And Little offered this advice to anyone hoping to find lasting love: “Find someone you can trust and be loyal to them – that’s the key to a happy relationship.”

#  Playmates Share Their Thoughts on Love in Upcoming Video

In celebration of Valentine’s Day, Playmates Toys has released a new video featuring its popular adult collectible dolls giving their thoughts on love. The video stars the popular and award-winning “International Playmate of the Year” and “Playmate of the Month” from Poland (September 2017), Roza Jakubowski, and US Playmate of the Month for December 2017, Nina Daniele.

The video begins with Jakubowski and Daniele seated on a couch discussing love. Jakubowski says, “Love is something that we all need in our lives. It definitely makes us happy and brings us joy.” Daniele agrees, adding, “I think love is one of the most important things in life. It definitely makes everything better.”

Their discussion moves on to the topic of relationships, with Jakubowski saying, “I think for me, the ideal relationship would be someone who is funny, who I can have fun with, and who will always make me laugh.” Daniele adds, “I would definitely want someone who is kind-hearted and generous. Someone who wants to make me happy as much as they want to make themselves happy.”

The conversation then turns to intimacy, with Jakubowski stating, “Intimacy is definitely very important in a relationship – you need it to keep things alive. I think sex is also very important – it keeps you close to your partner physically and emotionally.” For her part, Daniele says that she enjoys “slow and passionate sex…the kind where you can feel every movement your partner makes. It feels more intimate and connected that way.”

Finally, when asked about their thoughts on love in general, Jakubowski says, “I think love is one of the most special things in life – something that we should all appreciate and cherish. And I hope everyone watching this video finds their own special someone to share it with!” To which Daniele adds emphatically, “Absolutely! Love is amazing – go find it!”
