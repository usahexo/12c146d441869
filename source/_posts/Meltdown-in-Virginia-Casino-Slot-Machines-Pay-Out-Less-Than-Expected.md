#  Meltdown in Virginia: Casino Slot Machines Pay Out Less Than Expected

#

Slot machines in a number of casinos in Virginia are paying out less than expected, according to state regulators. This has led to frustration among casino customers and employees alike.

#

The Virginia Lottery said on Tuesday that it was investigating the matter, and it urged the casinos involved to do the same. It also said it would work with the casinos “to ensure that players receive the appropriate payout percentages.”

A lottery spokeswoman, Carrie O. Davis, would not say how much less the slot machines were paying out than expected, except that it was “not a big discrepancy.” She also would not say which casinos were involved but said they were all owned by Penn National Gaming Inc.

In a statement, Penn National said that its slot machines were operating within their expected payout range assertions Davis called misleading and wrong Fox News reported Wednesday however that two unnamed sources told the news organization that the discrepancy ranged from 2 to 7 percent .Penn National spokeswoman Kerry Howard told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that whatever the percentage might be it is within what is expected . Slot machines are supposed to return about 94 percent of money wagered to players over time . That figure is known in the industry as the hold percentage . A 2 or 3 percent difference is insignificant :
3% of $100 = $3 hold     which means you'd get back $97 for every $100 you put into the machine

#  Virginia's Slot Machines are Paying out Less Than the Rest of the Country

Gamblers in the Commonwealth of Virginia have been dealt a bad hand recently as their slot machines are paying out less money than in other parts of the United States.

The average slot payout percentage in Virginia casinos was 90.89% in January, according to industry tracker Slot Player magazine. That's down from the national average of 95.48%, and a far cry from the 98% or better payouts that players can find in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. It's also lower than neighboring Maryland (93.14%) and West Virginia (91.59%).

There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. One is that casino operators have decided to reduce their slot payouts to increase profits. Another possibility is that Virginia's machines are configured in a way that results in them paying out less money than elsewhere.

Whatever the cause, it's not good news for Virginia gamblers. In the short term, it means they're losing out on potential jackpots; over the long term, it could mean that casinos start hemorrhaging customers to competitors with more favorable odds.

#  State of Virginia Investigates Slot Machine Payouts

The state of Virginia is investigating the payout percentage of slot machines after receiving numerous complaints from players. The investigation is being conducted by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

One player, who did not want to be identified, said she has played slots at various casinos for years and has never won more than $60 in a single game. "It's like they're rigged," she said. "I know I'm not the only one who feels this way."

A spokesperson for the department said that while there is no evidence that slot machines are paying out less than they should, the investigation is necessary to ensure fairness for players. He added that if it is determined that the payout percentage is lower than it should be, the department will take appropriate action.

This is not the first time that concerns have been raised about slots payouts. In 2013, a study by University of Nevada Las Vegas professor John Warren Kindt found that slots return percentage ranged from 82 percent to 96 percent, far lower than the 95 percent to 98 percent typically advertised by casinos.

Slot machine manufacturers dispute Kindt's findings, claiming that his figures are inaccurate. They say that the payout percentages on their machines are in fact much higher, but they do not release those numbers to protect their competitive edge.

Whatever the truth may be, it's clear that some players feel like they're not getting a fair shake when they play slots. The state of Virginia's investigation should help to provide some clarity on this issue.

#  Is Virginia's Slot Machine Strategy flawed?

There's been a lot of buzz in the Virginia General Assembly about how to allocate money from the state's new slot machine revenue. House Speaker, William Howell has put forth a proposal that would direct 25% of the new revenue to funding K-12 education, 25% to higher education and 50% to transportation.

Governor McDonnell has offered an alternative that would direct 55% of the new revenue to transportation, 20% each to education and health care and 5% to tourism promotion.

There are those who argue that any plan is better than no plan, but I believe that Virginia's strategy for allocating slot machine revenue is flawed. Here's why:

First, it's important to remember that slot machines are a regressive tax. That means that they take a larger percentage of income from low-income people than from high-income people. So, by directing more of the new revenue to transportation, Governor McDonnell is effectively taking money away from education and health care and giving it to wealthier people.

Second, there is no guarantee that the new revenue will actually go towards transportation projects. The majority of it could be funneled into the general fund, where it would be used for purposes other than transportation improvements.

Finally, even if all of the new revenue does go towards transportation projects, there is no guarantee that it will be spent wisely. In fact, there is ample evidence that most states are not good at spending transportation money efficiently.

For these reasons, I believe that Virginia should direct more of the new slot machine revenue towards education and health care instead of transportation.

#  Casinos Struggle to Keep Virginians Interested in Slots with Lower Payouts

Virginia’s casino industry is in a bit of trouble. Slot machine payouts are down, and that means that casinos are struggling to keep Virginians interested in their games.

The average slot payout percentage in Virginia casinos in 2017 was 89.9 percent, down from 93.5 percent in 2016, according to the American Gaming Association. That’s the fifth-lowest payout percentage of any state.

The reason for the decline is unclear. But one possibility is that casinos are responding to increased competition from video poker and other forms of gambling by lowering their payouts in order to make more money.

Whatever the reason, the lower payouts are making it harder for casinos to compete with other forms of gaming. In particular, Virginians seem to prefer playing video poker at local restaurants and bars, where they can get better odds.

“There’s no question that the overall trend is that payouts are going down,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. “That has an impact on how much people are spending and how often they’re visiting casinos.”

Casinos have been trying to address the situation by offering more variety in their games and by increasing their marketing efforts. But so far, those efforts have not been enough to boost interest in slots.
