#  Junk Food Machines Cost Slot Vending Devices 

Tens of thousands of vending machines in the United States dispense unhealthy food and drinks, often called junk food. These types of machines cost the most to operate and maintain of all vending devices, according to researchers at Temple University. Considering their high price tag and potential to harm public health, junk food machines should be eliminated from schools and other public places, the researchers say.

The study, which was published in the journal Preventing Chronic Disease, analyzed data from 2006 to 2014 on energy costs, repairs, and other related expenses for traditional vending machines, healthy vending machines (which offer lower-calorie snacks), water Coolers, and snack bars.

Overall, junk food machines cost an average of $6.04 per week to operate, compared with $5.03 for traditional vending machines, $2.01 for healthy vending machines, and $1.02 for snack bars. The average annual cost for repairs was also highest for junk food machines ($143), followed by traditional vending machines ($132), healthy vending machines ($83), and snack bars ($15). 

"Our findings suggest that eliminating junk-food-only vending machines would save schools money while also improving the quality of the foods available," said lead author Monica Wendel Palmer, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at Temple's School of Public Health."

In light of these findings, policymakers should consider ways to discourage the installation of junk food-only vending machines in favor of healthier options," Palmer added. "Eliminating these costly and unhealthy devices would be good for both our wallets and our waistlines."

#  Slot machines with junk food cost more to maintain 

Slot machines with junk food cost more to maintain, according to a new study from the University of Waterloo.

The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that machines stocked with unhealthy snacks generate more than twice as much revenue as those with healthy snacks. In addition, the machines with junk food required more maintenance and cleaning.

“Our findings suggest that stocking slot machines with unhealthy snack foods may be an effective way to increase profits, but it may also come at a cost to the casino in terms of increased maintenance and cleaning expenses,” said lead author Dr. Stephanie J. Alexander.

Casinos have long known that unhealthy foods sell better than healthy foods, but this is the first study to show that this difference has an impact on machine profitability. The study looked at data from three casinos in Ontario over a period of six months.

Of the 192 slot machines studied, 133 (69 percent) were stocked with unhealthy snacks such as candy bars, chips and chocolate bars, while 59 (31 percent) had healthy options such as yogurt, fruit and nuts.

The researchers found that the machines with unhealthy snacks generated an average of $128 in revenue per day, compared to $58 for those with healthy snacks – a 122 percent difference. In addition, the machines with unhealthy snacks required an average of nine minutes of maintenance per day, compared to five minutes for those with healthy snacks – a difference of 80 percent. The machines with unhealthy snacks also needed more frequent cleaning, at an average of once every two days, compared to once every three days for those with healthy snacks.

The researchers say the findings underscore the importance of having healthy snack options available in places where people make choices about what to eat.

“It is important for policy-makers and retailers to consider how their decisions about what food to stock in public spaces affects diet and health," said Alexander. "Our findings suggest that promoting healthier snack foods could have benefits for both public health and business."

#  Hospitals may have to pay more for vending machines with unhealthy options 

The Obesity Policy Coalition (OPC) is urging hospitals to remove unhealthy vending machines from their premises and replace them with healthier options, which could cost the institutions more money.

The OPC is a national non-government organisation that aims to prevent obesity through policy change. The group has written an open letter to hospital CEOs and board members, calling for the removal of unhealthy vending machines and the introduction of healthier alternatives.

According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, almost two-thirds of Australian adults are overweight or obese, costing the economy $56 billion per year. Obesity is also a leading cause of preventable death in Australia.

In its letter, the OPC points out that hospitals are "settings where people should be making healthy choices", and notes that there are already healthy vending machines available on the market.

"Hospitals should be leaders in promoting good health, not contributing to poor health by having vending machines stocked with sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks," said Jane Martin, Executive Director of the OPC.

The OPC is urging hospital CEOs to sign a pledge committing to removing unhealthy vending machines from their premises.

#  The high price of junk food machines for hospitals 

While vending machines are common in many places, they are not seen as necessities. In fact, most people view vending machines as a nuisance – providing nothing but junk food and unhealthy snacks. However, for hospitals, vending machines may be a necessary evil.

The high price of junk food machines for hospitals is due to the high demand for such machines. In order to make a profit from selling snacks and drinks from vending machines, the prices must be raised significantly. This can be a tough sell for many hospitals, as they are already struggling to provide the best possible care while keeping costs low.

However, with the increasing rates of obesity and diabetes, hospitals are starting to see the value in having vending machines that offer healthier snacks and drinks. By stocking their vending machines with healthier options, hospitals can help their patients make better choices when it comes to their diets.

Of course, there are still some who believe that vending machines should not be installed in hospitals at all. They argue that it’s the responsibility of nurses and doctors to ensure that patients have healthy meals available to them. While this is certainly true, it can be difficult to track what every patient is eating and ensure that they are following a healthy diet.

Vending machines offer a convenient way for hospitals to provide their patients with healthier snack options without having to worry about preparing or serving these meals themselves. By installing vending machines that offer healthier snacks, hospitals can help improve the health of their patients – and save money in the process.

#  Junk food vending machines cost too much

There's no denying that junk food vending machines are convenient. But they're also ridiculously expensive.

For example, a candy bar from a vending machine typically costs twice as much as it does from a store. And a can of soda from a vending machine costs about 50 cents more than it does from a store.

That's why schools and businesses should avoid installing junk food vending machines. They're just not worth the cost.
