#  What is Crystal Mania? 

Crystal Mania is an app for iPhone and Android that consists of colorful and mesmerizing shapes that you can move around with your finger. It was created by Good Job Games, who are also responsible for the popular game “2048”.

The objective of the game is to connect all of the same colored shapes together. When you do this, they will disappear and you will get points. The more shapes you connect at once, the more points you will get. There are also special crystals that appear from time to time. If you connect five of these in a row, you will get an extra life.

If at any point you make a mistake and touch a shape that isn’t the same color as the others, it will turn black and you will lose a life. If you lose all of your lives, then the game is over.

There are three different modes to play in Crystal Mania: Classic Mode, Time Attack Mode, and Infinite Mode. In Classic Mode, you have to clear all of the shapes on the screen before time runs out. In Time Attack Mode, you have to clear as many shapes as possible within one minute. In Infinite Mode, there are no time constraints and the goal is to get as high a score as possible.

#  What is the Crystal Mania Game? 

Crystal Mania is an amazing puzzle game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. The premise of the game is to connect adjoining crystal pieces to create a chain and clear them from the board. This can be done by either swapping two adjacent crystals, or rotating the entire board by 90 degrees. 

The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible before either running out of moves, or the timer runs out. There are also various obstacles and power-ups to help or hinder your progress. For example, some crystals are locked and can only be freed by using a power-up. Others explode when touched, damaging surrounding crystals. 

There are a number of different game modes to choose from, including: 

* Normal Mode – Clear all of the crystals from the board in as few moves as possible. 
* Time Trial Mode – Race against the clock to clear all the crystals. 
* Challenge Mode – Clear all of the crystals from multiple boards one after another. 
* Survival Mode – Keep clearing crystals until you run out of moves or time. 
* Zen Mode – Relax and take your time clearing all of the crystals.
