#  Former President George Walker Bush Dies at Age 94

Former President George Walker Bush died on Friday night, November 30, 2018, at the age of 94. According to a statement from his spokesman Jim McGrath, Bush passed away surrounded by family at his home in Houston, Texas.

Bush was America’s 43rd president, serving one term from 2001 to 2009. He was also the father of 43rd president George W. Bush and the grandfather of 44th president Donald Trump.

In a statement following his father's death, George W. Bush said he was "so proud" of his father. "He was a man of integrity and decency who embodied the values of our nation," he said. "He will be deeply missed, and I’m grateful for the life he gave me."

Born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, Bush enlisted in the Navy on his 18th birthday and became one of its youngest pilots during World War II. After the war ended, he attended Yale University and then started a successful career in oil business.

Bush began his political career in 1966 when he was elected to represent Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. He served as ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of the Republican National Committee before being elected governor of Texas in 1994. In 2000, he won the presidential election against Al Gore by 537 votes in Florida after a contentious recount process.

During his time in office, Bush faced two major crises: the September 11 terrorist attacks and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. His approval ratings plummeted amid criticism over how he handled both events, but they gradually recovered toward the end of his term.

After leaving office, Bush wrote a book about his experiences as president and founded The George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. He made several public appearances in support of wounded veterans and relief efforts after major natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. 

In spite of their differences, Trump paid tribute to Bush following his death , saying he "was a very good man and will be missed."

#  How Blackjack Ended Up Being Called Pontoon George Walker Bush

The game of blackjack is thought to have originated in France in the 17th century. It was called Vingt-et-Un, which means Twenty-One in French. This name came about because the goal of the game was to draw cards until you had a hand total of 21. If your hand exceeded 21, you lost automatically.

In the early 1800s, the game made its way to America and was renamed Pontoon. There are several theories about how this new name came about. One theory is that American sailors took the game with them on their voyages to South America and it picked up its new name there. Another theory is that English smugglers brought the game to America and named it after a type of boat called a pontoon.

The game of Pontoon remained popular in America throughout the 1800s. In fact, it was so popular that it eventually became the national card game. However, its popularity began to decline in the early 1900s and by 1920, it was largely forgotten.

It wasn't until casino gaming began to take off in Vegas in the 1950s that blackjack once again became popular. The casinos began marketing it as a glamorous and exciting game and it soon became one of the most popular casino games played today.

#  The Surprising History of How Blackjack Came to Be Called Pontoon George Walker Bush

Whether you know it as pontoon, blackjack, or pontoon blackjack, this casino classic has an interesting and surprisingly diverse history. Today we'll take a look at the different versions of this game that have popped up over the years and how they've each contributed to the modern version we enjoy today.

Pontoon originated in England in the early 18th century. At that time, it was known as Twenty-One and was simply a game where players tried to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The ace was worth 1 point, 2s through 10s were worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (JQK) were each worth 10 points. If you ended up with more than 21 points, you automatically lost the hand.

The game remained largely unchanged for the next hundred years or so. In 1971 however, a new version called pontoon blackjack began popping up in casinos across Australia. This variant used the same basic rules as Twenty-One, but added an interesting twist - players could double down on any two cards.

This new rule quickly caught on and soon began appearing in other countries as well. The name pontoon also began to spread, eventually replacing Twenty-One as the most popular name for the game. Over time, additional rules have been added or changed, but the basic premise remains the same - try to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.

So whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, be sure to check out pontoon blackjack - it's one of the most popular casino games around for a reason!

#  Pontoon George Walker Bush: One of the Unlikely Origins of America's Favorite Card Game

If you mention the game of pontoon to most people, they'll think you're talking about a large boat. But in reality, pontoon is a popular card game that's often compared to blackjack. And believe it or not, one of the unlikely origins of this game is former President George W. Bush.

Back in the early days of his presidency, GWB was often seen playing pontoon with his staffers and Secret Service agents. In fact, he even hosted a pontoon tournament at the White House in 2003. This event was part of a fundraiser for the Fisher House Foundation, which provides free or low-cost housing for military families who are undergoing treatment at nearby hospitals.

So how did GWB become interested in playing pontoon? It seems that he picked up the game during his years as Governor of Texas. And since he was a fan of blackjack, it wasn't long before he started playing pontoon as well.

These days, GWB still enjoys playing pontoon whenever he has the chance. And according to some reports, he's actually quite good at it. In fact, one journalist who played against him described him as "a skilled and fearless player."

Whether you're a fan of George W. Bush or not, it's hard to deny that he played an important role in popularizing pontoon around the world. So next time you play this game, be sure to thank him for his contribution!
