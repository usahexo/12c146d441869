#  How to Play Blackjack without a Dealer in Azerbaijan 

If you’re looking for a casino game that you can play without fear of being cheated, blackjack is a great choice. The key to success in blackjack is learning the right strategy and then sticking to it.

A few things to remember while playing blackjack:
1. You should always stand when your hand value equals 17 or more.
2. If the dealer has an Ace up, you should hit if your hand value is between 6 and 16.
3. If you have two cards of the same rank, you can split them into two separate hands.
4. If the dealer has an Ace up and a number card (2-10), he will automatically take another card (a hit). In this case, you should also take a hit if your hand value is less than 17.
5. If the dealer has a 10 up, he will automatically stand.
6. You can double down on any two cards, but you will only receive one more card after doubling down.
7. You can only Insurance if the dealer has an Ace up (since he could have a blackjack). 
8. You can’t go bust – if your hand total goes over 21, your bet will be forfeited and you will lose regardless of the Dealer’s hand total.

#  Learn the Rules of Blackjack for Azerbaijan without a Dealer 

The casino game of blackjack can be enjoyed by people in Azerbaijan without having to worry about a dealer. All you need is some understanding of the basic rules and strategies involved. The following information covers the basics that you need to know in order to get started.

To begin with, blackjack is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points (a blackjack) or by scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21. In order to achieve this, players can either hit (take another card) or stand (stop taking cards). If they go over 21, they bust and lose the hand.

In addition, players can also place side bets on various outcomes, such as whether their first two cards will be a pair (two cards of the same rank), whether the player will win or lose the hand, and so on.

Here are the basic rules for playing blackjack in Azerbaijan:

1) Before starting the game, each player must place an initial bet (the amount you want to wager). This bet goes into the pot and is used to pay out winning hands. 
2) The dealer then deals two cards face up to each player, as well as two cards face up to themselves. 
3) Players can then choose to hit (taking another card) or stand (stopping). 
4) If a player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. 
5) The dealer must stand on all 17s and draw on all 16s. 
6) The winner is the player who has scored closest to 21 without going over. If both players have bust, then the player with the highest score wins (even if it’s less than 21). 
7) In addition to your standard bet, you can also place side bets on various outcomes such as whether your first two cards will be a pair, etc. 
8) After all bets have been placed, each player draws another card face up – this card becomes their third card. 
9) The dealer then draws one final card which is revealed once all other players have finished playing their hands. 
10) The winner is then determined based on their final score (see point 6 above).
